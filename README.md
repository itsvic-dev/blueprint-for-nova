**Blueprint for Nova** is a fork of [Blueprint](https://blueprint.zip), an extension framework for Pterodactyl.

> [!WARNING]
> Blueprint for Nova is **beta-quality software**, and 100% compatibility should not be expected as of now. If you run into any issues, [contact us](https://discord.gg/CkYF9Jm8rB).

This fork of Blueprint is made for [Nova](https://getnova.zip), a theme for the Pterodactyl panel. **This will not work on a stock Pterodactyl installation, nor is it meant to!**
